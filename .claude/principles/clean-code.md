# Uncle Bob — Clean Code, Clean Architecture & SOLID

Follow these rules when writing and reviewing code. They are drawn from Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_, _Clean Architecture_, and the SOLID principles.

## Core Philosophy

Code is read far more often than it is written. Optimize for readability above almost everything else. First drafts are messy — the craft is in the rewriting.

Leave the code cleaner than you found it (Boy Scout Rule). Every commit should improve the codebase slightly.

## Functions

- Keep functions small. Under 20 lines is a good target.
- A function should do one thing, do it well, and do it only.
- Operate at one level of abstraction per function. Don't mix high-level policy with low-level string parsing in the same function.
- Minimize arguments. Zero is ideal, one or two is fine, three is suspicious, more than three needs strong justification. If you need many parameters, consider grouping them into an object.
- Don't use flag arguments (booleans that make a function do two different things).
- Prefer exceptions over return codes.
- Extract until every function reads like a single logical step.
- Avoid side effects. A function named `getUser` should not also modify state. If it does, the name should reflect that.
- Prefer pure functions where practical — same inputs, same outputs, no hidden state.
- Return early to avoid deep nesting. Guard clauses up top, happy path below.

## Naming

- Names should reveal intent. `elapsedTimeInDays` over `d`. `isEligibleForOvertime()` over `check()`.
- Classes get noun names (`Employee`, `OrderRepository`). Functions get verb names (`calculatePay`, `sendEmail`).
- Avoid abbreviations and single-letter names outside of tiny loop scopes.
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase (e.g., `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for types/classes).
- Name booleans as predicates: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `shouldRetry`.
- Name functions after what they do, not how they do it.
- Don't be clever or cute. `kill()` over `whack()`.
- Don't use encodings or prefixes like Hungarian notation (`strName`, `m_count`).
- Use consistent vocabulary. Pick one word per concept and stick with it (`fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` should not coexist for the same idea).

## Comments and Documentation

- A comment is a failure to express yourself in code. If you need one, first try rewriting the code so it doesn't need one.
- Comments explain _why_, not _what_. Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure.
- Acceptable comments: legal headers, TODOs, warnings about consequences, clarification of intent when the code truly cannot be made clearer.
- Never commit commented-out code. Delete it. Version control remembers.
- Document public APIs, non-obvious design decisions, and known limitations.
- Keep comments maintained. A stale comment is worse than no comment.

## Error Handling

- Use exceptions, not return codes.
- Write try-catch-finally blocks first when writing code that can fail.
- Don't return `null`. Return empty collections, Optional, or a sensible default. Returning `null` pushes null-checking onto every caller.
- Don't pass `null` as a function argument.
- Create informative error messages that provide context about what failed and why.
- Use typed/structured errors over raw strings when the language supports it.
- Distinguish between recoverable errors (retry, fallback) and programmer errors (crash, fix the bug).
- Fail fast and fail loudly in development.

## Classes and Objects

- Classes should be small in responsibility, not just line count.
- Single Responsibility Principle: a class should have one reason to change, meaning one stakeholder whose needs could cause modification.
- High cohesion: methods should use most of the class's instance variables. If a subset of methods only touches a subset of fields, that's a new class waiting to be extracted.
- Prefer composition over inheritance when practical.

## Structure and Organization

- Files should read like newspaper articles: headline (class name), synopsis (high-level public methods), then details (private methods, helpers) as you scroll down.
- Keep related code vertically close. A function and the functions it calls should be near each other.
- Group code by feature/domain, not by technical layer, when the codebase is large enough to warrant it.
- Keep files focused. If a file requires extensive scrolling or has multiple unrelated sections, split it.
- Manage dependencies deliberately. Depend on abstractions where volatility is high; depend on concretes where stability is high.
- Be consistent with your team's formatting conventions. Consistency matters more than any individual rule.
- Keep lines short. If you have to scroll horizontally, the line is too long.

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility (SRP)

A class has one reason to change. "Reason" means one actor or stakeholder. If two different departments could request changes to the same class, split it. When you describe what something does and use the word "and," that's a hint.

### Open/Closed (OCP)

Open for extension, closed for modification. Add new behavior by adding new code (new classes, new implementations), not by editing existing code. Polymorphism, strategy patterns, and plugin architectures all serve this.

### Liskov Substitution (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking program correctness. If a subclass surprises callers of the base class, the hierarchy is wrong.

### Interface Segregation (ISP)

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Prefer small, focused interfaces over large, general-purpose ones. If implementers routinely leave methods as no-ops or throw `NotImplemented`, the interface is too wide.

### Dependency Inversion (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Inject dependencies (usually via constructor injection) rather than creating them internally. Your business logic shouldn't import a specific Postgres driver directly; it should depend on a repository interface that a Postgres implementation satisfies.

## Dependency Injection

- Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concretions (implementations).
- Pass dependencies in through constructors. Don't have classes instantiate their own collaborators.
- DI frameworks are tools, not architecture. Constructor injection is usually sufficient. Don't let Spring, Guice, or similar frameworks dictate your design.
- Dependencies should point inward: business rules at the center know nothing about databases, UI, or frameworks on the outside.

## Switch Statements

- Switch statements on type codes are a code smell. They tend to get duplicated across the codebase and violate OCP.
- Replace with polymorphism: each case becomes a subclass that implements the behavior.
- A switch is tolerable if it appears exactly once, lives in a factory, and is used to create polymorphic objects.

## Tests

- Follow TDD's three laws:
    1. Don't write production code until you have a failing test.
    2. Don't write more of a test than is sufficient to fail.
    3. Don't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the test.
- Tests should be F.I.R.S.T.: Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely.
- Keep tests clean and readable. Test code is as important as production code.
- One concept per test. Aim for one logical assertion per test (not necessarily one `assert` call, but one idea being verified).
- Write tests that describe behavior, not implementation. Tests should survive refactors.
- Use descriptive test names that read as specifications: `rejects_expired_tokens`, `returns_empty_list_when_no_results`.
- Avoid testing private internals. Test the public interface.
- Keep tests fast. Slow tests don't get run.

## Boundaries

- Wrap third-party APIs in your own thin abstraction layer. Don't let external types leak across your codebase.
- This lets you swap implementations, control the interface, and isolate breakage when the third party changes.
- Write learning tests for third-party code to verify your understanding and detect breaking changes on upgrades.

## Law of Demeter

- A method should only call methods on: its own object, its parameters, objects it creates, and its direct collaborators.
- Avoid train wrecks: `a.getB().getC().doThing()` exposes too much internal structure.
- "Tell, don't ask." Tell objects what to do rather than interrogating their internals.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Duplication is the primary enemy of clean code. Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation.
- If you find yourself copying and pasting, extract the common logic.
- This applies to logic, not just literal text. Two blocks that look different but encode the same business rule are still duplication.
- Don't abstract prematurely either. Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction.

## General Discipline

- Prefer immutability and const-correctness by default.
- Optimize for readability first, performance second — unless profiling tells you otherwise.
- Delete dead code. Unused imports, unreachable branches, vestigial functions — remove them.
- Keep diffs small. Small, focused commits and PRs are easier to review, easier to revert, and less likely to introduce bugs.

## Pragmatism

These are guidelines, not rigid laws. They matter most when codebases are large, teams are big, and requirements are evolving. For a small script, prototype, or spike, strict adherence is counterproductive. Use judgment.
